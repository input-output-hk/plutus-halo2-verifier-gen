## Overview

This project bridges Rust-based Halo2 implementations with Plutus smart contracts on Cardano. It
extracts verification keys and circuit structures from Halo2 circuits and generates corresponding Plinth verifier code
that can validate proofs on-chain.

## Features

- **Circuit-Agnostic Generation**: Automatically generates Plinth verifiers for various Halo2 circuits
- **Template-Based Code Generation**: Uses Handlebars templates for flexible verifier generation
- **Multiple Circuit Types**: Supports basic Halo2 circuits, lookup tables, and custom gates

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Halo2 proof generation in Rust** (`src/`)
    - Circuit definitions and implementations
    - Proof generation and verification

2. **Plutus Generation Pipeline** (`src/plutus_gen/`)
    - `extraction/`: Extracts circuit data from Halo2 structures
    - `code_emitters.rs`: Generates Plinth code from templates that is optimized to verify a particular circuit

3. **Plutus Verifier** (`plutus-verifier/`)
    - Common Plinth code for Halo2 verification
    - Template files for circuit-tailored code generation

### Workflow

1. Define Halo2 circuit in Rust
2. Generate proving/verifying keys
3. Extract circuit structure and constraints
4. Generate Plinth verifier code using templates
5. Integrate verifier into Plinth smart-contract to be deployed on Cardano

## Build prerequisites

The prototype consists of two main parts:

1. The Rust component generates a Halo2 proof and produces the corresponding Plinth verifier code.
    - it can be build using the standard `cargo` tooling from the root of the repository.
2. The Plinth component contains template files and serves as the target location for inserting the generated Plinth
   verifier.
    - Plinth smart contract can be build using `cabal` in `nix` environment.

#### How to install and use nix

1. Install `nix` - the package manager

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

2. Modify the conf file `/etc/nix/nix.conf` by adding

```
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://cache.iog.io
trusted-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
allow-import-from-derivation = "true"
```

3. The contract can be build from the relevant templates folder using the nix shell:

```bash
nix develop github:input-output-hk/devx#ghc96-iog
cd plutus-verifier
cabal build -j all
cabal test all
```

If you have build errors due to missing package descriptions like this:

```bash
.....
Error: cabal: No cabal file found.
Please create a package description file <pkgname>.cabal
Failed to build random-shuffle-0.0.4. The failure occurred during the
configure step.
.....
```

just try to re-run the build (may require several re-runs).

## Running Examples

### Rust part

The repository includes several example circuits:

* `simple_mul` - Simple multiplication circuit with standard PLONK gates
* `atms` - Advanced ATMS (Aggregate Threshold Multisignature) circuit for aggregating signatures with threshold
  validation. Based on [input-output-hk/sidechains-zk](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-zk)
* `atms_with_lookups` - A circuit that verifies ATMS signature and lookup argument
* `lookup_table` - A circuit with lookup argument

These circuits can be run in two versions: one using the GWC19 flavor of multi-open KZG, and the other using the
multi-open protocol described in Halo2 book.

```bash
# Simple multiplication circuit (Halo2 KZG)
cargo run --example simple_mul

# Simple multiplication circuit (GWC19 KZG)
cargo run --example simple_mul gwc_kzg

# ATMS (Aggregate Threshold Multisignature) circuit Halo2 KZG
cargo run --example atms

# ATMS (Aggregate Threshold Multisignature) circuit GWC19 KZG
cargo run --example atms gwc_kzg

# ATMS with dummy lookup tables (Halo2 KZG)
cargo run --example atms_with_lookups

# ATMS with dummy lookup tables (GWC19 KZG)
cargo run --example atms_with_lookups gwc_kzg

# Lookup table circuit (Halo2 KZG)
cargo run --example lookup_table

# Simple multiplication circuit (GWC19 KZG)
cargo run --example atms_with_lookups gwc_kzg

# With detailed logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example simple_mul

# With Plutus traces (note that Plutus traces will increase contract cost!)
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example simple_mul --feature plutus_debug
```

Running an example will generate the verification and proving keys for the circuit, create a proof using test public
inputs, and produce the corresponding Plinth verifier code. The generated files will be saved in their respective
locations within the plutus-verifier folder:

* The generated proof is saved in `./plutus-verifier/plutus-halo2/test/Generic/serialized_proof.json`.
* The public inputs are saved in `./plutus-verifier/plutus-halo2/test/Generic/serialized_public_inputs.hex`.
* The generated Plinth code is saved in:

```
./plutus-verifier/plutus-halo2/src/Plutus/Crypto/Halo2/Generic/Verifier.hs
./plutus-verifier/plutus-halo2/src/Plutus/Crypto/Halo2/Generic/VKConstants.hs
```

### Plutus part

After the Rust part is executed you can test Plutus verifier as follows:

```bash
nix develop github:input-output-hk/devx#ghc96-iog
cd plutus-verifier
cabal build -j all
cabal test all
```

## Benchmarks

Below are the execution costs of Plutus scripts running the Halo2 verifier for various circuits (with multiopen KZG
variant from Halo2 book):

| Circuit description             | Script size<br/>(% of script limit 14kb) | CPU usage               | Mem usage         |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Simple mul**                  | 6434  (44.8%)                            | 3,729,441,762  (37.29%) | 1,549,444 (11.0%) |
| **Lookup table**                | 11250 (78.4%)                            | 6,490,814,414  (64.91%) | 2,915,417 (20.8%) |
| **ATMS (50 out of 90)**         | 11838 (82.5%)                            | 7,624,238,863  (76.24%) | 2,974,279 (21.2%) |
| **ATMS (228 out of 408)**       | 11838 (82.5%)                            | 7,624,238,863  (76.24%) | 2,974,279 (21.2%) |
| **ATMS (50/90) + lookup table** | 14128 (98.5%)                            | 9,043,652,303  (90.44%) | 3,877,297 (27.7%) |

**Note that the benchmark numbers are approximate.** Even for the same circuit, the verifier’s execution cost may vary
slightly depending on the specific proof being verified. This variation stems from the randomness used during proof
generation, which can be influenced by the initial seed or the platform on which the prover runs.
